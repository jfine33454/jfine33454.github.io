<h1>Taylor Swift</h1>

<body>
    <p>Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Her versatile artistry,
        songwriting, entrepreneurship, marketability, and support for the Kansas City Chiefs have influenced the music
        industry, popular culture, and politics, and her life is a subject of widespread media coverage.</p>

    <p></p> Swift began professional songwriting at 14. She signed with Big Machine Records in 2005 and achieved
    prominence as a
    country pop singer with the albums Taylor Swift (2006), Fearless (2008), and Speak Now (2010). The singles
    "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" were crossover successes on country and pop radio
    formats and brought Swift mainstream fame. Her fourth studio album, Red (2012), experimented with electronic
    elements and featured her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one single, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together".
    Swift recalibrated her image from country to pop with 1989 (2014), a synth-pop album supported by the chart-topping
    songs "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood". Media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-influenced Reputation
    (2017) and its number-one single "Look What You Made Me Do".</p>

    <p>After signing with Republic Records in 2018, Swift released the eclectic pop album Lover (2019) and the
        autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She explored indie folk styles on the 2020 albums Folklore
        and
        Evermore, subdued electropop on Midnights (2022), and re-recorded four albums subtitled Taylor's Version[a]
        after a
        dispute with Big Machine. These albums spawned the number-one songs "Cruel Summer", "Cardigan", "Willow",
        "Anti-Hero", "All Too Well", and "Is It Over Now?". Her Eras Tour (2023–2024) and its accompanying concert film
        became the highest-grossing tour and concert film of all time, respectively. Swift has directed several music
        videos
        and films such as Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions (2020) and All Too Well: The Short Film (2021).</p>

    <p>One of the world's best-selling musicians, with over 200 million records sold as of 2019, Swift has been named
        Global Recording Artist of the Year three times by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry,
        whereas six of her albums have opened with over a million sales in a week. She is the highest-grossing female
        touring act, the most-streamed woman on Spotify and Apple Music, and the first billionaire with music as the
        main
        source of income. The 2023 Time Person of the Year, Swift has appeared on lists such as Rolling Stone's 100
        Greatest
        Songwriters of All Time, Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists, and Forbes' World's 100 Most Powerful Women.
        Her
        accolades include 14 Grammy Awards (with a record four Album of the Year wins), a Primetime Emmy Award, 40
        American
        Music Awards, 40 Billboard Music Awards, and 23 MTV Video Music Awards.</p>
    <h2>Life and Career</h2>

    <h3>Early life</h3>

    <p>Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989,[1] in West Reading, Pennsylvania.[2] She is named after
        singer-songwriter James Taylor.[3] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, is a former stockbroker for Merrill
        Lynch[4]
        and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), worked for a time as a mutual fund marketing executive.[5]
        Taylor
        has a younger brother, actor Austin Swift.[6]</p>

    <p>Swift's mother is of Scottish and German descent, and her father is of Scottish and English descent with distant
        Italian ancestry.[7][8] Swift's paternal great-great-grandfather, Charles Carmine Antonio Baldi, was an Italian
        immigrant entrepreneur and community leader who opened several businesses in Philadelphia in the
        1800s.[9][10][8]
        Her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay (née Moehlenkamp), was an opera singer.[11]</p>

    <p>Swift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm that her father had purchased from one of his
        clients.[12][13]
        She is a Christian.[14] She attended preschool and kindergarten at Alvernia Montessori School, run by Bernardine
        Franciscan sisters,[15] before transferring to the Wyndcroft School.[16] The family moved to a rented house in
        Wyomissing, Pennsylvania,[17] where Swift attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[18]</p>

    <p>At age nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy
        productions.[19] She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.[20] Swift later
        shifted
        her focus toward country music, inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her "want to just run around the
        block
        four times and daydream about everything".[21] She spent weekends performing at local festivals and
        events.[22][23]
        After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt she needed to move to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue
        a
        career in music.[24] She traveled there with her mother at age eleven to visit record labels and submitted demo
        tapes of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers.[25] She was rejected, however, because "everyone in that
        town
        wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be
        different."[26]
        She spent summers in Stone Harbor, New Jersey until she was 14 years old, performing in a local coffee
        shop.[27][28]</p>

    <p>When Swift was around 12 years old, musician Ronnie Cremer taught her to play guitar. Cremer helped with her
        first
        efforts as a songwriter, leading her to write "Lucky You".[29] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working
        with
        New York–based talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch as part of their
        "Rising Stars" campaign, had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD, and met with major record
        labels.[30] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, Swift, then 13 years old, was given an
        artist development deal and began making frequent trips to Nashville with her mother.[31][32][33] To help Swift
        break into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch's Nashville office when she was 14
        years
        old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee.[12][34] Swift attended Hendersonville High
        School[35]
        before transferring to Aaron Academy after two years, which better accommodated her touring schedule through
        homeschooling. She graduated one year early.[36][37]</p>

    <h3>2004–2008: Career beginnings and first album</h3>

    <p>In Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett
        James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers[38][39] and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz
        Rose.[40] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[41] Rose called
        the sessions "some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what
        happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with
        the most incredible hooks." Swift became the youngest artist signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house,[42]
        but left then BMG-owned RCA Records (later bought by Sony Music) at the age of 14 due to the label's lack of
        care and them "cut[ting] other people's stuff". She was also concerned that development deals can shelve
        artists[33][23] and recalled: "I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years
        of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through."[43]</p>

        in 2007 and 2008.[44]At an industry showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of
        Scott Borchetta, a
        DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had
        first met Borchetta in 2004.[45] She was one of Big Machine's first signings,[33] and her father purchased a
        three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000.[46][47] She began working on her eponymous debut
        album with Nathan Chapman.[23] Swift wrote or co-wrote all album tracks, and co-writers included Rose, Robert
        Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[48] Released in October 2006, Taylor Swift peaked at number
        five on the US Billboard 200, on which it spent 157 weeks—the longest stay on the chart by any release in the US
        in the 2000s decade.[49][50] Swift became the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track
        on a US platinum-certified debut album.[51]</p>

    <p>Big Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, "Tim McGraw",
        which Swift and her mother helped promote by packaging and sending copies of the CD single to country radio
        stations. As there was not enough furniture at the label yet, they would sit on the floor to do so.[52] She
        spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour and television appearances; she opened for Rascal
        Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour,[53] as a replacement for Eric Church.[54] Borchetta said that
        although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift
        tapped into a previously unknown market—teenage girls who listen to country music.[52][12]</p>

    <p>Following "Tim McGraw", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Our
        Song", "Picture to Burn" and "Should've Said No". All appeared on Billboard's Hot Country Songs, with "Our Song"
        and "Should've Said No" reaching number one. With "Our Song", Swift became the youngest person to
        single-handedly write and sing a number-one song on the chart.[55] "Teardrops on My Guitar" reached number
        thirteen on the US Billboard Hot 100.[56] Journalists consider it Swift's breakthrough song in the US,[57][58]
        as it proved to be a crossover success on pop radio by charting for 21 weeks on the Mainstream Top 40—Swift's
        first single to do so.[59] Swift also released two EPs, The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and
        Beautiful Eyes in July 2008.[60][61] She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other
        country musicians' tours in 2006 and 2007, including those by George Strait,[62] Brad Paisley,[63] and Tim
        McGraw and Faith Hill.[64]</p>

    <p>Swift won multiple accolades for Taylor Swift. She was one of the recipients of the Nashville Songwriters
        Association's Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007, becoming the youngest person given the title.[65] She also
        won the Country Music Association's Horizon Award for Best New Artist,[66] the Academy of Country Music Awards'
        Top New Female Vocalist,[67] and the American Music Awards' Favorite Country Female Artist honor.[68] She was
        also nominated for Best New Artist at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.[69] In 2008, she opened for Rascal Flatts
        again[70] and briefly dated the singer Joe Jonas.[71]</p>

    <h3>2008–2010: Fearless </h3>

    <p>Swift's second studio album, Fearless, was released in November 2008 in North America,[72] and in March
        2009 in other markets.[73] On the Billboard 200, Fearless spent 11 weeks at number one, becoming Swift's
        first chart topper and the longest-running number-one female country album.[74] It was the best-selling
        album of 2009 in the US.[75] Its lead single, "Love Story", was her first number one in Australia and the
        first country song to top Billboard's Pop Songs chart,[76][77] and its third single, "You Belong with Me",
        was the first country song to top Billboard's all-genre Radio Songs chart.[78] Three other singles were
        released in 2008–2010: "White Horse", "Fifteen", and "Fearless". All five singles were Hot Country Songs
        top-10 entries, with "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" topping the chart.[79] In 2009, Swift toured as
        an opening act for Keith Urban and embarked on her first headlining tour, the Fearless Tour.[80]</p>

    <p>"You Belong with Me" won Best Female Video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.[81] Her acceptance speech was
        interrupted by the rapper Kanye West, an incident that became the subject of controversy and widespread
        media coverage.[82] That year, Swift won five American Music Awards, including Artist of the Year and
        Favorite Country Album.[83] Billboard named her 2009's Artist of the Year.[84] She won Video of the Year and
        Female Video of the Year for "Love Story" at the 2009 CMT Music Awards, where she made a parody video of the
        song with rapper T-Pain called "Thug Story".[85] At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, Fearless was named Album
        of the Year and Best Country Album, and "White Horse" won Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal
        Performance.[86] At the 2009 Country Music Association Awards, Swift won Album of the Year for Fearless and
        was named Entertainer of the Year, the youngest person to win the honor.[87]</p>

    <p>Throughout 2009, Swift featured on and wrote other musicians' releases. She featured on John Mayer's single
        "Half of My Heart" and Boys Like Girls' single "Two Is Better Than One", the latter of which she
        co-wrote.[88][89] She wrote "Best Days of Your Life" for Kellie Pickler[90] and wrote two songs—"You'll
        Always Find Your Way Back Home" and "Crazier"—for the soundtrack of Hannah Montana: The Movie, in which she
        had a cameo appearance.[91][92] She wrote and recorded "Today Was a Fairytale" for the soundtrack of
        Valentine's Day, in which she had her acting debut.[93] "Today Was a Fairytale" was her first number-one
        single on the Canadian Hot 100.[94] While shooting Valentine's Day in October 2009, Swift dated co-star
        Taylor Lautner.[95] On television, she made her debut as a rebellious teenager in an CSI: Crime Scene
        Investigation episode[96] and hosted and performed as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live; she was the
        first host ever to write their own opening monologue.[97][98]</P>

    <h3>2010–2014: Speak Now and Red </h3>

    <p>Swift's third studio album, Speak Now, was released in October 2010.[99] Written solely by Swift,[100] the
        album debuted the Billboard 200 with over one million US copies sold first week[101] and became the
        fastest-selling digital album by a female artist.[102] Speak Now was supported by six singles: "Mine", "Back to
        December", "Mean", "The Story of Us", "Sparks Fly", and "Ours". "Mine" peaked at number three and was the
        highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100,[103] the first three singles reached the top 10 in Canada,[94]
        and the last two reached number one on Hot Country Songs.[79] Swift promoted Speak Now with the Speak Now World
        Tour from February 2011 to March 2012[104] and the live album Speak Now World Tour – Live.[105]
        At the 54th Annual Grammy Awards in 2012, Swift performed "Mean", which won Best Country Song and Best Country
        Solo Performance.[106] She was named Songwriter/Artist of the Year by the Nashville Songwriters Association
        (2010 and 2011),[107][108] Woman of the Year by Billboard (2011),[109] and Entertainer of the Year by the
        Academy of Country Music (2011 and 2012)[110] and the Country Music Association in 2011.[111] At the American
        Music Awards of 2011, Swift won Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[112] Rolling Stone named Speak
        Now on its list of "50 Best Female Albums of All Time" (2012).[113]

        Swift on the Red Tour in 2013
        Red, Swift's fourth studio album, was released in October 2012.[114] On Red, Swift worked with Chapman and new
        producers including Max Martin, Shellback, Dan Wilson, Jeff Bhasker, Dann Huff, and Butch Walker, resulting in a
        genre-spanning record that incorporated eclectic styles of pop and rock such as Britrock, dubstep, and
        dance-pop.[115][116] The album opened at number one on the Billboard 200 with 1.21 million sales[117] and was
        Swift's first number-one album in the UK.[118] Its lead single, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", was
        her first number one on the Billboard Hot 100,[119] and its third single, "I Knew You Were Trouble", reached the
        top five on charts worldwide.[120] Other singles from Red were "Begin Again", "22", "Everything Has Changed",
        "The Last Time", and "Red".[56]
        Red and its single "Begin Again" received three nominations at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards (2014).[121] Swift
        received American Music Awards for Best Female Country Artist in 2012, Artist of the Year in 2013,[122][123] and
        the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist Award for the fifth and sixth consecutive years.[124]
        At the 2014 Country Music Association Awards, Swift was honored with the Pinnacle Award, making her the second
        recipient in history after Garth Brooks.[125] The Red Tour ran from March 2013 to June 2014 and became the
        highest-grossing country tour upon completion.[126]
        Swift continued writing songs for films and featuring on other artists' releases. On the soundtrack album to The
        Hunger Games (2012), Swift wrote and recorded "Eyes Open" and "Safe & Sound"; the latter of which was co-written
        with the Civil Wars and T-Bone Burnett. "Safe & Sound" won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual
        Media.[127] She wrote and produced "Sweeter than Fiction" with Jack Antonoff for the soundtrack to One Chance
        (2013).[128] Swift featured on B.o.B's "Both of Us" (2012)[129] and provided vocals for Tim McGraw's "Highway
        Don't Care" (2013), also featuring Keith Urban.[130] She was a voice actress in The Lorax (2012),[131] made a
        cameo in the sitcom New Girl (2013),[132] and had a supporting role in the dystopian film The Giver (2014).[133]
        From 2010 to 2013, Swift was romantically involved with the actor Jake Gyllenhaal, the political heir Conor
        Kennedy, and the singer Harry Styles.[134]</p>

    <h3>2014–2018: 1989 and Reputation</h3>

    <p>In November 2018, Swift signed a new deal with Universal Music Group, which promoted her subsequent albums
        under Republic Records' imprint.[175] The contract included a provision for Swift to maintain ownership of her
        masters. In addition, in the event that Universal sold any part of its stake in Spotify, it agreed to distribute
        a non-recoupable portion of the proceeds among its artists.[176][177]</p>

    <p>A portrait of Swift
        Swift at the American Music Awards of 2019, where she was named Artist of the Decade
        Swift's first album with Republic Records, Lover, was released in August 2019.[178] She produced the album with
        Antonoff, Louis Bell, Frank Dukes, and Joel Little.[179] Lover peaked atop the charts of such territories as
        Australia, Canada, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Sweden, the UK, and the US.[180] The album spawned five singles:
        "Me!", "You Need to Calm Down", "Lover", "The Man", and "Cruel Summer"; the first two singles peaked at number
        two on the Billboard Hot 100, and the lattermost single became a resurgent success in 2023, reaching number
        one.[181] Lover was 2019's best-selling album in the US and best-selling album by a solo artist worldwide.[182]
        The album and its singles earned three nominations at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2020.[183] At the 2019
        MTV Video Music Awards, Swift won three awards including Video of the Year for "You Need to Calm Down", becoming
        the first female and second artist overall to win the category for a self-directed video.[184]</p>

    <p>While promoting Lover in 2019, Swift became embroiled in a public dispute with the talent manager Scooter Braun
        after he purchased Big Machine Records, including the masters of her albums that the label had released.[185]
        Swift said she had been trying to buy the masters, but Big Machine would only allow her to do so if she
        exchanged one new album for each older one under a new contract, which she refused to sign.[185] In November
        2020, Swift began re-recording her back catalog, which enabled her to own the new masters and the licensing of
        her songs for commercial use, substituting the Big Machine-owned masters.[186]</p>

    <p>In February 2020, Swift signed a global publishing deal with Universal Music Publishing Group after her 16-year
        contract with Sony/ATV expired.[187] Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Swift surprise-released two "sister
        albums" that she recorded and produced with Antonoff and Aaron Dessner: Folklore in July and Evermore in
        December.[188] Joe Alwyn co-wrote and co-produced a few songs under the pseudonym William Bowery.[189] Both
        albums incorporated a muted indie folk and alternative rock production;[190] each was supported by three singles
        catering to US pop, country, and triple A radio formats. The singles were "Cardigan", "Betty", and "Exile" from
        Folklore, and "Willow", "No Body, No Crime", and "Coney Island" from Evermore.[191] Folklore was the
        best-selling album of 2020 in the US[192] and, together with "Cardigan", made Swift the first artist to debut a
        US number-one album and a number-one song in the same week; she achieved the feat again with Evermore and
        "Willow"..[193]</p>

    <p>According to Billboard, Swift was the highest-paid musician in the US and highest-paid solo musician worldwide
        of 2020.[194] Folklore made Swift the first woman to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year three times,
        winning the category at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards (2021).[195] At the American Music Awards, Swift won three
        awards including Artist of the Year for a third record time (2020)[196] and Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist and
        Favorite Pop/Rock Album (2021).[197] Swift played Bombalurina in the film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's
        musical Cats (2019), for which she co-wrote and recorded the Golden Globe-nominated original song "Beautiful
        Ghosts".[198][199] The documentary Miss Americana, which chronicled parts of Swift's life and career, premiered
        at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival.[200]</p>

    <h3>Re-recordings and Midnights</h3>

    <p>Swift's re-recordings of her first six studio albums began with Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red
        (Taylor's Version), which were released in April and November 2021. Both peaked atop the Billboard 200, and
        the former was the first re-recorded album to do so.[201] Fearless (Taylor's Version) was preceded by "Love
        Story (Taylor's Version)", which made Swift the second artist after Dolly Parton to have both the original
        and re-recorded versions of a song reach number one on Hot Country Songs.[202] Red (Taylor's Version) was
        supported by "All Too Well (10 Minute Version)", which became the longest song in history to top the Hot
        100.[203]</p>


    <p>Swift performing in 2022
        Swift's tenth studio album, Midnights, was released in October 2022.[204] The album incorporates a
        restrained electropop[205] and synth-pop sound[206] with elements of hip hop, R&B, and
