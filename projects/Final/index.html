            <p>Arguably a first round pick, Keon attended Michigan
                State University before transferring to Florida State
                and
                playing wide receiver. At 6 '4 and 210 pounds, the wide receiver made 11 touchdowns in his 2023
                season.
                He ran
                658 yards receiving and made 50 receptions. At only 20 years old, Coleman serves as a new force
                and
                fills a much
                needed spot for the Bills after the departure of their old wide receiver Stefon Diggs. While his
                speed
                at the
                combine was not as fast as the other first round picks, Coleman also demonstrates a stronger
                athletic
                ability by
                being a three sport player, also having adamant basketball skills. As for some other stats from
                his
                college
                career, Coleman has punted 300 yards and made 58 long receptions in his 2023 season.

            </div>
            <p>Coming in at 6 '2 and a weight of 206, Cole Bishop was selected in the second round as a safety
                for the
                Bills.
                His combine results posted a 4.45 40-yard dash, 39” vertical jump, and a 10’4” broad jump. At
                Utah in
                his 2023
                season, Bishop assisted in 25 tackles and defended three passes. He made 60 tackles that season.
                Also
                during the
                2023 season at Utah, Bishop managed nine long interceptions and three defended passes. Earning a
                6.20
                combine
                score, he is a great candidate for a backup with the potential to develop into a steller
                starter.
                Combine score: 6.20

                team for
                three
                years (the longest there has ever been a single team captain) and he is now joining the Bills as

                defensive
                tackle, in his entire career at Duke, he posted 125 tackles.

            <p>Looking at Javon Solomon's draft and combine profile, he came in at 6 '1 and 246 pounds. He is on
                the
                smaller
                side for an edge player, but has the potential to develop into a starter. In his 2023 season he
                played
                ball at
                Troy college which is in Alabama. There he contributed to the win of three sun-belt conferences.
                He has
                a
                combination of traits that make him right for the job and with an experience in winning, his
                mindset is
                already
                there. His main trait is his pass rushing with a stat of 33 sacks at the end of his college
                career.

            <p>Travis Clayton has simply never played football. The Bills reasoning for drafting him was due to
                his
                elite
                athleticism playing rugby in Basingstoke England, where he entered the draft through the
                international
                portal
                and is now a Buffalo Bill.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Overall the Bills 2024 draft was given a grade of “B+” as their newly drafted players take to
                Buffalo and
                prepare for the upcoming season, can they live up to their predecessors?
