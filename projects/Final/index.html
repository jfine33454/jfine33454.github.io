        <h1>Buffalo Bills Draft Picks</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <img src="images/buffalo-bills-logo-transparent.png" alt="logo">
        <p>The Buffalo Bills entered the 2024 draft, looking to build depth in their team and fill a handful of
            positions.
            The General Manager, Brandon Beane selected 10 new players, their statistics can be seen below.
        </p>
        <h2>Round 2, Pick No. 33 - Keon Coleman, wide receiver, Florida State</h2>
        <img src="images/3200434f-4c29-5571-54fa-77236b775ae1.webp" alt="Keon Coleman">
        <img src="images/Screenshot 2024-05-08 at 12.43.21 PM.png" alt="Keon stats"
        <p>Arguably a first round pick, Keon attended Michigan
            State University before transferring to Florida State
            and
            playing wide receiver. At 6 '4 and 210 pounds, the wide receiver made 11 touchdowns in his 2023 season.
            He ran
            658 yards receiving and made 50 receptions. At only 20 years old, Coleman serves as a new force and
            fills a much
            needed spot for the Bills after the departure of their old wide receiver Stefon Diggs. While his speed
            at the
            combine was not as fast as the other first round picks, Coleman also demonstrates a stronger athletic
            ability by
            being a three sport player, also having adamant basketball skills. As for some other stats from his
            college
            career, Coleman has punted 300 yards and made 58 long receptions in his 2023 season.
        </p>
        <h2>Round 2, Pick No. 60 - Cole Bishop, safety, Utah</h2>
        <img src="images/32004249-5324-4955-7828-cfb9c0a6ebae.webp" alt="Cole Bishop">
        <img src="images/Screenshot 2024-05-08 at 12.46.17 PM.png" alt="Cole stats"
        <p>Coming in at 6 '2 and a weight of 206, Cole Bishop was selected in the second round as a safety for the
            Bills.
            His combine results posted a 4.45 40-yard dash, 39” vertical jump, and a 10’4” broad jump. At Utah in
            his 2023
            season, Bishop assisted in 25 tackles and defended three passes. He made 60 tackles that season. Also
            during the
            2023 season at Utah, Bishop managed nine long interceptions and three defended passes. Earning a 6.20
            combine
            score, he is a great candidate for a backup with the potential to develop into a steller starter.
            Combine score: 6.20
        </p>
        <h2>Round 3, Pick 95 - DeWayne Carter, defensive tackle, Duke</h2>

            40-yard-dash

            played the
            2023 season where he made 41 total tackles and four defended passes. He was the captain of his team for
            three
            years (the longest there has ever been a single team captain) and he is now joining the Bills as a
            defensive
            tackle, in his entire career at Duke, he posted 125 tackles.
        </p>
        <h2>Round 4, Pick 128 - Ray Davis, running back, Kentucky</h2>
        <img src="images/32004441-5663-2804-a8ce-2174ee79562e.webp" alt="Ray Davis">
        <img src="images/Screenshot 2024-05-08 at 12.51.18 PM.png" alt="ray stats"
        <p>Ray Davis played college football at Kentucky and comes in at 5 '10 and 216 pounds. He had 199 rushing
            attempts
            in his 2023 season and boasted 1,129 rushing yards in a single season. He also scored 14 rushing
            touchdowns in
            his final season at Kentucky and was drafted to the Buffalo Bills as a running back. Upon analysis, he
            is a
            strong candidate for a potential starter in his upcoming years as a Bill. In his 2023 season, Davis made
            12 runs
            of 20 or more yards which secured fans' feelings about his addition to the team. Overall, Davis played
            in 33
            career games and ran 4,815 yards.
        </p>
        <h2>Round 5, Pick 141 - Sedrick Van Pran-Granger, center/guard, Georgia</h2>
        <img src="images/32005641-4e71-5349-190d-7420371fab37.webp" alt="Sedrick Van Pran-Granger">
        <img src="images/Screenshot 2024-05-08 at 12.52.19 PM.png" alt="sedrick stats"
        <p>Coming in at 6’4 and weighing 298 pounds, Sedrick Van Pran-Granger was selected in the fifth round for
            Buffalo
            and earned a prospect grade of 6.22, making him a potential average starter. He joined the team from
            Georgia and
            is playing center for the Bills, completing their offensive line. In his 2023 season at Georgia, Van
            Pran-Granger was coached in one of the toughest mindsets, making him compatible with the pros. He is a
            tough
            candidate and said on his combine prospect sheet, he is gritty and ready to work. These stats and tools
            should
            help him succeed in the o-line.
        </p>
        <h2>Round 5, Pick 168 - Javon Solomon, defensive end, Troy</h2>
        <img src="images/3200534f-4c22-8092-733c-eec3f091d0b7.webp" alt="Javon Solomon">
        <img src="images/Screenshot 2024-05-08 at 12.53.21 PM.png" alt="javon stats"
        <p>Looking at Javon Solomon's draft and combine profile, he came in at 6 '1 and 246 pounds. He is on the
            smaller
            side for an edge player, but has the potential to develop into a starter. In his 2023 season he played
            ball at
            Troy college which is in Alabama. There he contributed to the win of three sun-belt conferences. He has
            a
            combination of traits that make him right for the job and with an experience in winning, his mindset is
            already
            there. His main trait is his pass rushing with a stat of 33 sacks at the end of his college career.
        </p>
        <h2>Round 6, Pick 204 - Tylan Grable, tackle, UCF</h2>
        <img src="images/32004752-4102-7444-a454-6645dfedea6f.webp" alt="Tylan Grable">
        <img src="images/Screenshot 2024-05-08 at 1.01.25 PM.png" alt="Tylan stats"
        <p>The Bills picked Tylan Grable in their sixth round and look to expand their offensive tackle depth.
            Grable is a
            6’6 306 pound player who attended the University of Central Florida and in his 2023 season, made many
            appearances. In his college career at UCF and Jacksonville State, Grable started in 43 games and
            according to
            his combine results, he may serve on the Bills as guard/tackle flexibility.
        </p>
        <h2>Round 6, Pick 219 - Daequan Hardy, cornerback, Penn State</h2>
        <img src="images/32004841-5209-0900-d135-816afa52800e.webp" alt="Daequan Hardy">
        <img src="images/Screenshot 2024-05-08 at 1.06.47 PM.png" alt="hardy stats"
        <p>Daequan Hardy played football at Penn State and was picked by the Bills to add to their center-back team.
            In his
            college career, he scored three touchdowns and held 248 yards in punt returns. He finished his Penn
            State career
            tied for fourth in school history in punt return touchdowns (2) and seventh in punt return average
            (14.6).
        </p>
        <h2>Round 7, Pick 221 - Travis Clayton, offensive tackle, England - International Player Pathway</h2>
        <img src="images/3200434c-4182-6931-55e8-0b9b4cf80da4.webp" alt="travis Clayton">

        <p>Travis Clayton has simply never played football. The Bills reasoning for drafting him was due to his
            elite
            athleticism playing rugby in Basingstoke England, where he entered the draft through the international
            portal
            and is now a Buffalo Bill.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Overall the Bills 2024 draft was given a grade of “B+” as their newly drafted players take to Buffalo and
            prepare for the upcoming season, can they live up to their predecessors?
